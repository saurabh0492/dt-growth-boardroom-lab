# DT Fellowship – Boardroom Lab: Growth Engineering via Prompted Strategy

This repository contains my submission for the **DT Fellowship Simulation Assignment** focused on growth strategy, prompt engineering, and boardroom-level decision design.

The objective of this work is to demonstrate how AI-assisted prompting, funnel diagnosis, and structured dashboards can be used to design scalable growth systems — not just analyze metrics.

---


### **Part 1: Prompt Engineering for Mass Personalization**
- Designed persona-specific AI prompts for:
  - CTO of a scaling D2C brand
  - COO of a pharma SME
- Applied the AIDCA framework with embedded Cialdini persuasion principles.
- Included negative prompts to ensure signal-driven, non-generic outputs.

### **Part 2: Funnel Debugging via Prompt-Based Diagnosis**
- Simulated a B2B funnel (Lead → MQL → SQL → Client).
- Diagnosed message–market fit failures at different stages.
- Proposed fix prompts mapped to AIDCA stages and persuasion principles.

### **Part 3: Boardroom Growth Dashboard**
- Designed a leadership-focused dashboard to convert outreach data into decisions.
- Includes:
  - Funnel conversion health
  - Campaign-wise AIDCA signal diagnosis
  - Persona performance snapshot
  - Strategic recommendations
- Dashboard visual and tables are included in the submission document.

### **Part 4: Strategic Reflection**
- Reflected on how prompting reshaped campaign narrative.
- Outlined a Growth Analyst mindset that uses AI for signal extraction and strategic iteration.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> Business is not about leads. It’s about levers.

This submission treats AI as a strategic tool to surface patterns, reduce noise, and improve decision clarity for leadership — not as a shortcut for content generation.
